      During 3rd or 4th day after planting spray Atrazine @ 2.5 kg/ha uniformly on
      the surface of field before the emergence of weeds. Chemical should be diluted
      in 1000liter of water and spray through hand sprayer. Separate hand sprayer
      and nossel should be used for herbicide application. Before application of fertilizer,
      weeds which are not controlled by herbicide application should be uprooted by
      hand weeding. By this method we can reduce the maximum level of crop damage.

      outside the cane fields, the attack will start from the boundaries. If they
      have burrows inside the field, the attack will be in patches at the beginning
      itself. After the cane harvest, the live burrows in and around the sugarcane
      fields are to be identified. This is done by first plugging the rat holes with
      mud and inspecting them the next day to check whether they are opened. The opened
      burrows indicate rat activity. These burrows should be applied with half half
      a tablet of celphos and the burrow mouth plugged with the mud. Since celphos
      is a fumigant with odour less poisonous gas it should be handled only by the
      experienced persons and two persons should handle it. The soft rind varieties

      leaf joint. The leaves are attached alternately to the nodes. The leaf sheath
      is tubular in shape and is inserted at the node. The leaf blade is linear or
      lanceolate reaching one to one and midrib is prominent with groove on upper
      surface. The ligule is a membranous ring found as an appendage of the sheath,
      separating the latter from the blade, and bears long hairs. The scarious extension
      of the leaf sheath is know as auricles.

      the changeover of the crop from vegetative to reproductive phase. At this stage,
      the stalk will contain stored sugar to support reproduction, but its sugar storage
      potential has not necessarily been realized. In a simple way ripening is storage
      of excess sucrose. If juice pol and purity percentages are more than 16 and
      85, respectively the cane is considered to be ripe. Several factors like soil
      fertility, added fertilizers (quantity and time), pests and disease attack in

  utter_not_power_sprayer_insecticides_shoot_borer_control:
  - text: For effective control of shoot borer, the insecticide should cover the site
      targeted by shoot borer in the plant which is the inner of the leaf sheath and
      collar region of the shoots. To cover such an area in each and every shoot,
      only high volume sprayers will be of use as the spray fluid can be directed
      precisely to the target region of each and every shoot. Moreover, the quantity
      of spray fluid to be used for the given length of row can be achieved correctly.
      Power sprayer is more suitable for foliage feeding pests.
  utter_not_sevidol_8g_effective_against_shoot_borer:
  - text: Granular insecticides, in general, can only give less coverage to target
      parts of plants than EC formulations for contact action. Moreover application
      of granules on leaf whorls of very small shoots numbering about one lakh in
      an acre is extremely difficult. More so, because sand is to be used as diluents
      with the granules, due to improper mixing of granules and sand, many a time
      shoots will receive no granule or sublethal dose only. Further, the slight fumigant
      action of carbaryl as fumigants will not be effective in the open and the slight
      systemic action of gamma sevidol is not of any consequence as even the fully
      systemic Furadon or Temik are not effective against shoot borer. Also, using
      a combination insecticide like sevidol is unscientific as it would render both
      insecticides useless due to development of cross resistance. Also, one of the
      components of Sevidol, viz gamma BHC is already banned by the government.
  utter_not_shoot_borer_controlled_application_lindane_chlorpyriphos:
  - text: If the application procedure described earlier is followed it will certainly
      give control of the borer. Further, dead heart formation by shoot borer takes
      a few days to a few weeks depending on the instar attacking the shoot, age of
      the shoot, prevailing weather and varietal ability. So, if new dead hearts are
      noticed even after the insecticidal application, they would have been the shoots
      already damaged by the borer and were in the process of drying at the time of
      insecticide application.

    text: Among various riputes of sugarcane production, although nutrients contribute
      maximum to the increase in yield. During vegetation the sugarcane consumes many
      nutrients. There is no doubt that sugarcane crop needs nutrients. The most active
      uptake of nutrients is observed during the early stage of the sugarcane plant,
      during tillering (from the third to the sixth months after planting). The nutrient
      needs of sugarcane can be assessed by soil analysis, plant tissue analysis and
      / or deficiency symptoms. A combination of these three methods gives the most

      sugarcane naturally and with use of organics and also preparation of jaggery
      with use of organic clarificants assumes importance in order to produce quality
      jaggery. There is a growing demand for organically produced jaggery both within
      the country and in the export market. For preparation of organic jaggery, the
      sugarcane should be grown in field free from any residue of chemical fertilizers,
      herbicides, pesticides etc. from the previous crop. Follow all the recommended
      techniques for growing the sugarcane by applying only organic source of required
      nutrients, totally avoiding pesticides and herbicides. For controlling the pest,
      biocontrol methods may be adopted.

      Indian types S.barberi and the Chinese S.sinenses and (b) thick, juicy noble
      canes S.officinarum. Highly prized cane is S.officinarum. The origin of S.officinarum
      is the Indo-Myanmar China border with New Guinea as the main centre of diversity.
      The officinarums are called the noble canes due to thick, juicy, low-fibred
      canes of high sucrose content. The origin of S.robustum is New Guinea. The origin
      of S.spontaneum is subtropical India. The habitat of these two wild canes is

      detect presence of insects in fields and give an indication to initiating pest
      control measures with appropriate insecticides or biological control agents
      at the right time. Pheromone traps are lures that contains the female hormones
      to attract the male insects. When pheromone lure is placed in dispenser and
      kept in the trap, pheromone from dispenser gradually evaporates and spreads
      in air by diffusion process. Male species of insects receives the smell of pheromones
      and get attracted to the lures, which serve as female trap, and male insects
      eventually get trapped. Insecticides with knock down and fumigation effect,
      such as dichlorvos, kerosene and diesel are used to kill trapped males, which
      might have otherwise mated with females to produce innumerable eggs. Once the
      insect enters the trap, it will not be able to come out.

  utter_role_nutrient:
  - text: Plants require 16 essential nutrient elements. Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
      are derived from the atmosphere and soil water. The remaining 13 essential elements
      (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, iron, zinc, manganese,
      copper, boron, molybdenum, and chlorine) are supplied either from soil minerals
      and soil organic matter or by organic or inorganic fertilizers. These nutrients
      are essential for proper crop development. Each is equally important to the
      plant.[website] ({link})
  utter_root:
  - text: The root system is fibrous and in two types namely ‘sett roots’ and ‘shoot
      roots’. When the sugarcane sett is planted in the soil, the root primordial
      situated at the base of every cane joint is activated and produces roots. These
      roots are ‘sett roots’ and are mostly temporary. Sett roots can emerge within
      24 hours of planting. The shoot roots arise from the root rings of the lower
      nodes of tillers. These roots are thick, fleshy, white and less branched. These
      are permanent roots which are continually produced from tillers. Shoot root
      emerges from the base of the new shoot 5 -7 days after planting.

      borer larvae which have to move from one clump to another only through the soil
      surface as leaves of adjacent clumps will not touch each other during that age
      of crop. Moreover, the trash will encourage development of general predators
      such as spiders, carabid beetles etc which increase chances of predation of
      the moths and the dispersing larvae. However, the possibility of cut worm or
